# Swift Samples

This repository includes simple Swift examples for demonstration:

- `HelloWorld.swift` prints a classic greeting.
- `NumberGuess.swift` is a small text-based game where you guess a random number.
- `DiceGame.swift` lets you challenge a simple AI in a dice rolling contest.

## Running the examples

Use the Swift interpreter to run the files:

```bash
swift HelloWorld.swift
swift NumberGuess.swift
swift DiceGame.swift
```
